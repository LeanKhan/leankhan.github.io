				<h4 id="what-is-fs-pro-sef"><em>What is Fs-Pro sef?</em></h4><p>FS-Pro stands for Football Simulator Pro. Pro doesn’t have a particular meaning yet. At first it was ‘professional’ but that sounded too serious. And it implied that there was an ‘unprofessional’ version of the game??? So No.</p><p>FsPro is a football manager simulation game kini. I and my brother have this football game we play with our created teams and players, but it’s only a simulation. We use dice to produce results and record them with pen and paper, with league tables and all. One Friday February 22nd, 2:17pm I decided to automate it. What started out as a simple js file to randomize match results has turned into this <em>really-awesome-coding-exprience!</em>. For those few weeks when it was called ‘Football-Simulator’ I never wrote so much javascript in my life (I haven’t been writing js for that long anyways: &lt;br a year), I stretched my knowledge of CSS, HTML and Javascript, I loved EVERYTHING. It was rough and gritty but it worked.</p><small>
<u>
Early days when everything was on one page
</u>
</small><img src="/assets/images/football-simulator-1.png" alt="Football Simulator first working version" title="Football Simulator early days"><p>I created an Express server to serve the <code>index.html</code> page with one javascript file and connected it to a MongoDB database, we played our three leagues and everything was fine.</p><small>
<u>
Early fixtures page
</u>
</small><img src="/assets/images/fixtures-old.png" alt="Old fixtures page" title="Old fixtures page"><small>
<u>
Newer fixtures page
</u>
</small><img src="/assets/images/fixtures-newer.png" alt="Newer fixtures page" title="New fixtures page"><small>
<u>
The glorious match page (so proud of this ᕦ( ᴼ ڡ ᴼ )ᕤ)
</u>
</small><img src="/assets/images/match-view.png" alt="Match center" title="Match center"><p>Until we wanted to add more functionality.</p><p>We wanted to make it realer. This meant:</p><ul>
<li>Increasing the number of players from 7 to 11</li>
<li>Adding functionality to buy, sell and trade players i.e create a Transfer Hub</li>
<li>Add web sockets for real time communication between managers (us)</li>
</ul><p>Each part of our app was a separate html file so it meant I would have to register sockets for each page? tough.
Then there was the Transfer Hub. Where you can buy and sell players. As I began working on it I noticed more and more parts of the app needed to be dynamic and I was repeating A LOT of things. I was stuck tbh. I started making the transfer hub April 20th. Didn’t do anything till May 23rd. Then on May 25th, I couldn’t continue.</p><small>
<u>
File structure of the Express app
</u>
</small><br><img src="/assets/images/file-structure-1.png" alt="Football Simulator file structure"><br><small><u>Transfer Hub right about when I got stuck =(</u></small><p><img src="/assets/images/transfer-hub-1.png" alt="Transfer hub before I got stuck"></p><h4 id="i-decided-to-rewrite-it-in-vue">I decided to rewrite it in <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>.</h4><p>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</p><p>Here it became ‘FsPro’</p><blockquote>
<h4 id="so-vue-innit"><em>So Vue innit?</em></h4>
</blockquote><p>I chose Vue because I liked it. Using a framework meant I wouldn’t have to repeat code and it’s easier to make some things dynamic but I missed writing my <em>vanilla</em> JavaScript.</p><p>Other pros were:</p><ul>
<li>Better routing</li>
<li>Faster development</li>
<li>Babel. Meaning I could run it on the old iPad I used for testing</li>
</ul><p>My setup was Vue + <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (because I wanted share code ,like classes and interfaces, with the server).</p><p>Things were going alright until I was adding more views. I didn’t know how to structure my codebase in the form of ‘modules’ so I could separate concerns and all. That bothered me for a while. So…</p><h4 id="i-decided-to-rewrite-it-in-angular-hohohoho">I decided to rewrite it in <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> <em>hohohoho</em></h4><p>┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻</p><p>I knowwww.</p><blockquote>
<h4 id="beht-why-tho"><em>Beht why tho?</em></h4>
</blockquote><p>The first framework I used was Angular. I started learning Vue after I got frustrated with Angular and its complexity. But for a few months now I have been working on a team whose main frontend stack is Angular. So obviously I had to use it then. During that time, I began to appreciate the framework even more. We were building a large scale enterprise app so I got to see Angular being used in that capacity. It was during that time that I decided to move it to Angular.</p><p>The pros of choosing Angular:</p><ul>
<li>It’s modular architecture is perfect for FsPro. It’s easier for me to understand</li>
<li>Supports TypeScript out of the box. Awesome!</li>
<li>It feels more ‘solid’ :3</li>
</ul><p>While <em>searching</em> for a UI framework for <a href="https://github.com/LeanKhan/fs-pro-client">FsProClient</a> I ‘discovered’ this Angular Admin UI framework called <a href="https://akveo.github.io/nebular/">Nebular</a> based on Bootstrap 4. A Godsend really, I was giving up on writing frontend code :#, but thank God. It’s easy to use and flexible like Bootsrap Vue or something similar and has cool Angular components like <a href="https://material.angular.io">Angular Material</a> (but not enough, Material is a whole ‘nother beast)</p><p>So that’s the setup now. Angular 8 + Nebular UI system. I made the repo public from the beginning because I need epp.</p><p>Find it <a href="https://github.com/LeanKhan/fs-pro-client">here</a>.</p><p>I am so proud of what FsPro is turning out to be, it has great potential. I don’t even know what it really is yet.</p><p>From February 22nd when I made the first commit in Football Simulator to August 14th when I initialized FsProClient, I think we have tried.</p><p>Hopefully no more rewrites :)))</p><blockquote>
<h4 id="wawu-so-if-this-is-fsproclient-what-about-the-server"><em>wawu, so if this is FsProClient what about the server?</em></h4>

I would write a post about it soon ─=≡Σ((( つ◕ل͜◕)つ
