FeedMe was a food delivery service I started in my first year at AUN. The idea was to collect multiple orders at the same time to reduce the delivery fee for each order. Each delivery cost around 300 Naira then, so if 10 students ordered they would only need to pay 30 Naira.

What I did:

- Designed and developed the entire system; I used ExpressJs to render the pages and added some VueJS for some dynamic components.
- Setup the database and hosting which was MongoDB and Heroku.
- Designed the logo and other marketing materials
