Hapy is a Hausa-based programming language that compiles to Python. We made Hapy so that Hausa kids that don't know English can still learn aspects of programming. Hapy started out as our final school project, but I intend to continue developing it.

What I did:

- Initiated some of the ideas and was de  facto project manager
- Built the compiler using Python
- Made the CLI using Click.
- Assisted in designing and developing the project website.
- Worked on parts of the Final Report
