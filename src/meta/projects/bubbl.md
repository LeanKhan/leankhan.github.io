Bubbl is a social network for campuses. We wanted to create localized social networks that hid everything else. Each 'bubbl' is embedded within a bigger 'bubbl'. That means the smallest Bubbl was your estate, for example, that estate was in another Bubbl, your city, which was in another Bubbl, your country, and so on up to the global Bubbl.

We took inspiration from how local newspapers only reported local news but a local story could 'Bubbl up' to be a National or Global sensation. We only implemented a minimal version of the idea; not the embedded part. Maybe someday...

What I did:

- Came up with ideas and strategies.
- Developed the web app using VueJs and Vuetify.
- Worked on a basic passwordless Auth system that enabled students to use their school email to login to Bubbl.
- Made a link proxy to provide shareable links with better SEO.
- Worked with the rest of the team to do Marketing.
