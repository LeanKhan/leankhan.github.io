Quiztory uses a simple Machine Learning technique to generate basic quiz questions from Wikipedia articles. I focused on articles on Nigerian history and the questions were mostly “when-” ones. It’s actually so basic. I’m including it here because it’s my only AI project yet. It was the semester project for an AI class.

What I did:
- Idea
- With help from various tutorials I developed the algorithm to take a chunk of text and extract the data I need to transform into questions.
- Also wrote the paper, I might try to publish but it's not much lol
