FoodBae was a food delivery service we started in school that allowed students to place orders in batches to spread delivery costs. I called it Food Pooling.

What I did:

- Designed and developed the entire system; I used ExpressJs to render the pages and added  VueJS for dynamic components.
- Setup the database and hosting with MongoDB and Heroku.
- Designed the logo and other marketing materials for both projects.
