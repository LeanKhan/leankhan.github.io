I remember in Uni I told a girl the title she suggested for a fictional book we wanted to create was "ew".
I didn't know while sending that text she was offended, so it was odd when she didn't look at me when I went to say hi later that evening at the Cafetaria. After stoning whatsapp messages her way asking for an explanation she told me calling her suggestion "ew" made her angry. I apologised but we never continued on that book. In fact, we essentially stopped talking since then.

I still think the title wasn't great, but I should've been nicer in how I said that. To make it worse I followed the insult with "how about we try [my own suggestion]". I thought being blunt would make things easier but they just ruined a budding friendship. 

No one has flat-out told me my work was "ew". I haven't gotten much negative feedback let alone abrasive comments about _my_ work. I know many times you can qualify my stuff as "ew". So why don't I hear it? It's either I don't ask enough for feedback or people aren't just telling me the truth. 

And I fear that's the cost of my years of over-bluntness. People may be less likely to give me their honest opinions after shitting on their own work. I don't know if this is correct but maybe.

Points:
- Because of my blunteness people may feel I'm fragile and wouldn't want to hurt my feels.
- It's mostly peers and friends I ask for feedback maybe they feel giving negative feedback will harm our relationship. I

These days I tend to be too generous when giving feedback. I just don't care. What does
