I wrote and published this on [Medium](https://medium.com/p/4140ec205a47) when I was starting [FeedMe](/projects#feedme). FeedMe was an idea for Food Delivery service at my University in Yola, but it didn't work out. I copied and republished it as is on my blog because I want all of my writing to be in one place. Enjoy!

At some points in your life you will be challenged by an opportunity, or a thought — leading to an idea. Opportunities demand something from us. They make us anxious.Opportunities demand that we leave our comfort zones and betray our own rationality. Opportunities are good because they expose us to the [adjacent possible](https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072047/http://agilelifestyle.net/the-adjacent-possible).

> The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations.

We can only explore these new possibilities if we take the leap — The Leap of Faith. For us at feedMe that leap was starting. That's it. We had to start, no platform, nothing. No precedence whatsoever, just a haunch. In your own life you will have to take certain leaps at some point to move to the next level. The overhead image illustrates 4 possible outcomes of meeting an opportunity.

#### Outcome 1
This happens to the giver-uppers. People who hesitate and doubt too quickly. Don't do it. Giver-uppers are swayed by circumstances and what lies ahead. Giver-uppers avoid unpredictable situations, they forget about the light we cannot see. The Giver-upper in scenario 1 had come a long way only to discover that a large chasm,the big hole,lay in front of him/her/it. “Surely this can't be for me” this giver-upper thought. And so time and energy spent pursuing this goes to the drain. “At least I didn't fail”

#### Outcome 2
If you don't give up there's a high chance you are willing to jump. However you just don't cut it. This scenario is rare; most people make it. But sometimes, just sometimes you don't give it that extra oomph that could get you to the other side. Your Leap of Faith turns out to be a hop of doubt. You need leaps not hops! There is good news however. If you don't make it and fall down, you wipe the dirt off your clothes and use the ladder conveniently placed nearby. That is Outcome 2.5.

#### Outcome 3
The third and most frequently achieved outcome is the successful leap. Everyone likes a successful leap, such a person jumped well enough, trusted that they would land on the other side in one piece. And they did. All is well with the world right? Wrong! Not everyone wants to just make progress. Yes, you took the leap, you scaled through and are off to face another challenge. But there is so much more you can do!

#### That brings us to Outcome 4
This is what we aim for at feedMe, Greatness. This is not your regular Leap of Faith. This is a super-sonic-mega-ultra-michealjordan-kinda Leap. We don't just want to get to the other side. We want to explore our adjacent possibles. We are leapfrogging everything — even the laws of gravity! We do this to land a place among the stars. We look upwards to God who gave us this vision. We are coming.

Thank you for reading.
